## Why This Project Exists

The goal is to:
- understand neural network limitations
- observe extrapolation failure
- explore confidence estimation
- contrast machine learning with symbolic reasoning

## How to Run

1. Open `RNGCalc.ipynb`
2. Run all cells top to bottom
3. Use the interactive prompt at the end to test inputs

Works best in **Google Colab** or a local Python environment with PyTorch.
